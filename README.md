TRS80-BASIC
===========



Some BASIC implementations for the TRS-80
-----------------------------------------

:construction: WORK IN PROGRESS :construction: 

This repository contains source code for several implementations of Microsoft's BASIC-80 
interpreter, incorporating original label names and comments wherever possible 
from ALTAIR BASIC and the GW-BASIC GitHub project.

I also included 2 subprojects containing the LSI (Logical System Inc. / Misosys) extensions for
the Model 4 editions of BASIC and BASICG.

See branch [`develop`](https://github.com/GmEsoft/TRS80_BASIC/tree/develop).
The following BASIC versions are included:
- Model I Level II BASIC
- Model 4 TRSDOS 6.2 Disk BASIC and Hi-Res BASICG
- Model 4 LS-DOS 6.3 Disk BASIC with LSI enhancements
- Model 4 LS-DOS 6.3 Hi-Res BASICG with LSI enhancements
- CP/M `MBASIC.COM` version `5.21`
